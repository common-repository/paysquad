Paysquad: Group Payments for WooCommerce. Buy now, pay together with Paysquad, the easiest way to share the cost with others, and avoid the IOUs.

== Description ==

Paysquad is the world’s first ‘buy now, pay together’. We make it easy for friends, family and colleagues to chip in for amazing gifts and experiences, right at checkout, without the messy admin and awkward IOUs.

From birthdays to baby showers, group holidays and work farewells — Paysquad makes group payments a breeze so people can spend more time celebrating and less time on admin.

On the other hand, merchants like you love having us at their checkout because we reward them with increased cart sizes and allow them (for the first time ever) to connect with multiple customers at the point of sale. In one sale, you could acquire 10 customers!

Each Paysquad payment that is started creates a WooCommerce order and moves it to a pending state. When it is completed, we will let you know and settle the payment. Automatic refunds are also supported.
